album-release-NLP
=================

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project created for a school assignment. The project automatically extracts key information from press releases announcing the release of musical albums.

Please see ***Drews_project.pdf*** for a detailed report of the goals, methodology, and results of this project. I received a grade of "A" for this assignment.

This project relies on the [Jet NLP tool](http://cs.nyu.edu/grishman/jet/jet.html). To run the project, please install Jet, then run it and select *album.jet* as the properties file. This will instruct the Jet tool to utilize the dictionary and language pattern files included in the repository.
