Gold Panda
Half Of Where You Live
<TEXT>
Nearly three years after the release of his debut album Lucky Shiner,  Gold Panda returns with his second album Half Of Where You Live, to be released on Ghostly International and his own NOTOWN label (UK). The album is the product of a period spent touring the world multiple times around, absorbing influences and probing potential new avenues of creative exploration.

Half Of Where You Live represents a stylistic and thematic advancement from Gold Panda's previous work, expanding on the ideas he presented on 2012's Mountain/Financial District 7" and this March's Trust EP. It reflects its creator's nomadic existence — you can see the influence of his travels in track titles like 'Brazil' and "Enoshima," in the oriental textures of "My Father In Hong Kong 1961" and "We Work Nights," and in the sounds of "Junk City II," conceived as a hypothetical soundtrack to '90s anime and the films of controversial director Takashi Miike.

"These films depicted a post-economic boom Tokyo in the 1990s", the producer explains, "and there was a last days feeling in them. [The feeling] still lurks [in Japan]. I saw a return to that possible dystopia. I've seen people in Osaka walking around, jobless, mental, stricken. I think real desperation and poverty is returning; it's quite scary."

The whole album, in fact, is described as a "city album" by its maker, and it's easy to see why — each track possesses a different aesthetic and reflects a different environment. Gold Panda describes it as "a jump from location to location… I felt like I was stealing a piece of each place I went to." 'Community' is a house-tinged reflection on cultural divides in London, while "Brazil" catalogs Gold Panda's arrival in Sao Paolo: "I wanted to make a track that soundtracked my ride from the airport to downtown" he explains. "The [vocal] sample is kind of like an excited chant, bigging up the place, then it all gets confusing to replicate the traffic and buildings."

Taking on this loose concept has meant a more considered approach for Gold Panda, and the music has harsher edges than his previous work, and an almost hauntological feel at times. Crucially, though, this new approach hasn't  compromised the producer's creative freedom, and the album still flows with his trademark organic vibrancy. "I've tried to really focus on just a few elements," he explains. "I tried to avoid chopped up female vocals this time around, as it's become pretty well done, and anything that was too solid structurally. Ultimately, though, you just you find your groove and settle into a sound and realize you only really need to please yourself."

Press release album Planetas
<TEXT>
Brazilian singer Simone Moreno is back with the album "Planetas" (Soul Dog Records) – a journey into the sun and around the world in a swirling, dancable orbit. The follow-up to the success "Samba Makossa" features afrobrazilian rhythms, pop, reggae and samba soul mixed with nordic melodies and aims just at one target: a constant, irresistable groove! With all songs penned by Simone with her swedish band Os Lourinhos, there's a strongly personal mark in the music. Having toured together for more than 10 years, they have formed a heavy percussive sound that circles around Simone's strong voice, in which there lies a concern that nobody can miss, whether you understand her billowing portuguese or not. On "Planetas", Simone tells her story about Brazil, about her new life in Europe, about poverty problems, about gods and entities. She speaks of lifegiving water, and of the love that flows through the planetary system and sometimes reaches us here on earth.

"Janaína" brings us to a market in north-eastern Brazil, where the old men bark, the accordions wail and the girls' feet levitate an inch above the ground. In "Zumbí", a crazy guitar makes us dance all the way to Africa and in forró-reggae blaster "Vida de cão (Dog's Life)", swedish rapper Timbuktu joins forces with Simone, as she snares about a life with no work, nor money. "Cadê você" follows that path, being a mellow and haunting samba reggae groove, speaking of the kids on the streets of Salvador. "Água" was written while a monsoon rain stopped all movements one summer's day in Bahia.
There's a song in swedish: "För alltid" (Forever) – a duet with Hofstone, aka Anders von Hofsten, who leads Os Lourinhos and was Simone's man for 11 years. It's a separation song and a very special melancholic mixture of Nordic melodies and Latin American groove. "Bambakerê" takes us on a funk odyssey with bubbling organs and surdo drums, that touches down in Bahia, where the boys trance dance in popcorn baths and among saint images and the funky 6/8 groove of the cousin "Oxossi" makes us ride with S:t George on his white horse… "Meu bem" is a samba pop pearl with horns that smell of the 70's and the title track "Planetas" is a calm and fragile samba love letter. The album is closed with "Galático", a majestic reggae, guested by South African singer Andre de Lang.
"Planetas" is modern, yet eternal. Pure pop and a heavy rhythm feast in one. Do not be surprised if it's found on the moon in 500 years. It's already out there in the galaxy flying, and ready to dance with you.
"Planetas" was voted album of the year by various newspapers in Sweden and gained top reviews. Most recently, Simone and the album received the prestigious Manifest Prize in February 2012!

Voices from the press: "Modern, yet eternal and the roots spread over the southern hemisphere and find their way all the way up to the North…"
"A brilliantly put together album with an own mixture of brazilian, west african, carribean and afro american influcences…"
"Sunny samba, crazy reggae, electronic beats and crispy pop – all is gathered in Moreno's world and creates an obvious and unique style…"
"Moreno sings with a luminous voice"

Jay-Z Announces New Album "Magna Carta Holy Grail"
June 16, 2013
<TEXT>
Jay-Z just announced his upcoming album, Magna Carta Holy Grail. The album will be dropping July 4. Hov made the announcement during a commercial for Samsung during halftime of Game 5 of the NBA Finals. He is shown in the studio with a cavalcade of hip-hop production luminaries—including Rick Rubin, Timbaland, Pharrell, and Swizz Beatz—working on the new album. 

The album will be released first to Samsung Galaxy users who download a customized mobile app. Only the first million downloaders gain access to the album for free on July 4. The album will then be released to the general public three days later. More information about the app is available here.

What's striking about the ad is that it's a rare look at Jay-Z as a communicator in the studio as he talks to the producers and discusses his vision. In the video Jay describes the album saying, "The album is about like this duality. How do you navigate your way through this whole thing—like success, through failures, through all this—and remain yourself?"

Check out the press release below and let the speculation regarding Hov's fifteenth studio album begin.

BelO to Release New Album "Natif Natal" (Native born) in April 2014
April 2, 2014
<TEXT>
Haitian International artist BelO will release a new album titled Natif Natal (Global release date April 9, 2014) with a worldwide tour beginning in the United States. The Radio France International Discoveries winner's 4th album, Natif Natal, is a journey of emotional social struggles, love and the need to belong.
The social crusader is first a lyricist before a music composer, and it comes to no surprise that the first track "Detripay" (Gutted) depicts the world being pulled apart from the inside out revealing prostitution, human trafficking and rape. BelO's poetic vision and his colorful Kreyol proverbs are put on full display in Natif Natal. A constant social spirit throughout the entire album sending a message of hope (Track 4 Pa Lage), holding on to love (Track 10 Abondans), and despite critical labels of society one should be able to accomplish its mission in life (Track 9 Pa Koute Yo). Natif Natal is dedicated to mankind and the dream of a world without boarders (Track 11 Citizen of World).
Natif Natal is produced by Jean Belony Murat a.k.a BelO; arranged/final mixed by Andy Barrow. BelO refused to be shackled by the limitations of one genre and threw a wider net to capture various sounds for Natif Natal. "I am a native from Haiti, and I want to be part of the global musical movement" -BelO. Effortlessly, BelO's sound leaps from his native traditional Haitian roots, Rock/Pop, old school Reggae, vintage Bossa Nova and R&B. The structural shift across the whole album is very apparent. BelO's signature jazzy touch from his second album reappears while cultivating a more organic sound. BelO is known as being Haiti's live acoustic innovator, yet he has never recorded in that style. The recording features songs in a greener format like: a call-and-response chorus, acoustic guitar and Haitian Tambour (congas) arrangements (Track 4 Pa Lage & Track 13 Tinonm).
The album showcases upcoming local Haitian vocalist like Mandela (Track 4 Pa Lage) and Queen Bee (Track 10 Abondans), Haiti's renown rapper BIC (Track 6 Kase Tibwa) and the celebrated Haitian roots artist Eddy Francois -former lead singer of Boukman Ekperyanse Grammy nominated group (Track 9 Pa Koute Yo). From different parts of the world numerous artists have contributed to this multi-inspirational album: Fabrice Rouzier, Clement Belizaire, Wesner St-Louis, Andy Barrow, Charleson Duverne, Hans Dominique (Bwagri), Harold St-Louis, Dony Felix, Johnson St Cyr, Kali, Carlomagno Araya, Ismael Vergara, Monica Frias, Alive for God (chorus group), and Alessandro Vivianni.
Natif Natal's tour will begin April 11 at Artisphere, in Virginia where he performed in 2012 in a sold out concert, followed by April 13th: Festival International Nuits d'Afrique de Montreal Canada, April16-23: France, April 26-27: International Festival de Louisiana, May1-15: National tour in Haiti, May 23-25: Guadeloupe, May 30: Jamaica. Additional tour dates in Boston, Miami, New York, Europe and more on http://www.belohaiti.com. Natif Natal will be available on the iTunes Store.

New Album And Release Party Announced
April 2, 2014
<TEXT>
Our new record comes out at the end of this month and we're throwing a huge party at First Ave in Minneapolis on May 3rd. Below is the album cover and press release from Secret Stash Records.

On April 29th, 2014, the debut album from Sonny Knight & The Lakers, I'm Still Here, will be released in the US by Secret Stash Records on LP, CD, and digitally. For Sonny Knight, the making of his debut album nearly 50 years after recording his first single has effectively pushed the reset button on a long and interrupted career, bringing it around full circle musically and geographically. He and his new backing band, the Lakers, recorded I'm Still Here in a subterranean Minneapolis studio a scant seven blocks away from the basement studio beneath a long shuttered record store where he recorded his first 45 (as Little Sonny Knight & The Cymbols) in 1965 at age 17.

Shortly thereafter, music took a back seat to a three-year stint in the army. A few more years in the Bay Area followed, before he returned to Minnesota in the mid-1970s and joined the now-cult favorite funk group Haze. By the early '80s, Haze had broken up and Sonny walked away from music for a full time job as a truck driver.

Unbeknownst to Sonny, not only had that lone 7" record he cut as a teenager ("Tears On My Pillow" B/W "Rain Dance") become a prized item in R&B collector circles in the ensuing decades, his powerful voice had not been forgotten. In the 1990s, vocalists Monroe Wright and Maurice Young (formerly of Minneapolis soul legends the Valdons) extended him an invitation to join their new group, The Bachelors. When the Valdons were revived in 2012 in celebration of Secret Stash Records' Twin Cities Funk & Soul compilation, Wright and Young tapped Knight as a new member.

After six months of working together on shows promoting Twin Cities Funk & Soul, Sonny and Secret Stash founder / in-house funky drummer Eric Foss formed Sonny Knight and The Lakers. In the spring of 2013, Sonny and the Lakers hit the ground running – playing gigs a few short weeks after their first rehearsal. Within months they had grown into their own as a band. In the fall, Sonny and the guys spent a long weekend at a cabin in Northern Minnesota and it became a defining moment. Staying up late, listening to old 45s, learning gospel songs, and wood shedding tunes was a way for the band to develop a similar vocabulary and refine their direction. It transformed them from a group of good players into a band. When they returned home, they set up a string of performances and residencies in Minneapolis and St. Paul. By the end of their residency at the Eagles club in South Minneapolis, virtually no breaks interrupted or slowed down their live sets. Non-stop rehearsals and live performances helped The Lakers tighten up their sound. That, coupled with the inspiration found during the cabin trip, laid the ground work for recording an album.

The way I'm Still Here was recorded was the product of many months of thought, just as the songs on the album were developed over hours of collaborative effort for Sonny and the band. The album covers a wide range of tempos and soul forms ranging from upbeat booglaoos, to beautiful ballads. Since the Lakers were spearheaded by a reissue label focused on obscure music, the band encompasses more than just Motown and Stax inspired sounds. The many hours spent digging for and listening to forgotten sixties and early seventies soul and funk records have practically oozed into the rehearsal space and studio. What stands out most are the strong performances by the band and Sonny's exuberance and energy. As a listener, there's never any doubt about what feelings he wants to convey.

Nearly fifty years have passed since Knight's first recording, but for the first time he feels like the center of attention. He says, "Sometimes I wonder, why me? Why are all these great things happening now? All I can say is thanks. These are dreams that I had forgotten. Only now that they are starting to come true do I remember that I had them at all."

To celebrate the April 29th release of I'm Still Here, Sonny Knight & The Lakers will headline a release party on May 3rd at Frist Avenue's Main Room (Minneapolis). The large scale show promises to be the greatest event produced by Secret Stash yet. With the help of First Avenue and sponsors 89.3 The Current and The Electric Fetus, as well as supporting acts The Honeydogs and Southside Desire, this promises to be a night never to forget.

Joe Crookston celebrates new album Saturday with release show
April 23, 2014
<TEXT>
Ithaca singer-songwriter Joe Crookston will unveil his new album "Georgia I'm Here" at the Hangar Theatre on Saturday night.

Recorded at Newfield's Electric Wilburland Studio, the new album showcases Crookston's evolution as an artist. He took inspiration from artist Georgia O'Keefe, who once said something to the effect of: "The parts of ourselves that we are most self-conscious of, are the parts of ourselves that are most uniquely true to who we are."

"I'm really into exploring what that is for me," Crookston said in an interview last week. "Even if people really don't understand it, I like that. I don't really fit in any kind of scene – I never have. And the new album is really about trusting the way I want to put music out."

Crookston acknowledged that on some of his previous albums, his songs were lyric driven, sometimes at the expense of the music. "I'm just playing with that balance of trying to make beautiful music with less dense lyrics," he said. "I think I'm getting somewhere, but it's only a step. This album still doesn't define me But I love about this CD is the songs are short and sweet and beautiful, and if you didn't speak English you could still put it on and it would still be beautiful to listen to."

He noted that he has written all kinds of songs. "If you listen to everything I've recorded, somewhere in that tapestry you might get to know who I am," he said. "I have funny songs, serious songs, philosophical songs, and it's the combination that adds up to who is Joe Crookston."

There's one cover song on the new album: Peter Himmelman's "Impermanent Things." "It's been in my notebook for 19 years, and when I go to record, I always like to do a cover, and that was at top of the list," Crookston said. "I covered my guitar strings with duct tape and it sounded so cool, like an African kora."

For Saturday's show, Crookston will be joined by frequent duo partner Peter Glanville on tenor and acoustic guitar. "I have more fun when I play with him, and the audience has more to listen to," Crookston said of Glanville, who has played with Hubcap and the Common Railers. "We connect really well. We talk a lot about how our guitars can blend together to become one sound."

Other guests will include bassist Jason Rafalak from Pittsburgh as well as Ithacans Jen Middaugh, Nate Richardson and Chris White — all of whom played on "Georgia I'm Here."

Crookston also will display some of hits recent paintings in the Hangar Theatre lobby before the show.

"For a lot of years I kept my visual art totally separate from my music — it just didn't have a place," he said. "But more and more, I'll take paintings to my shows and put them on display. Again, it's about 'who am I really?' The visuals of art and imagery of lyrics — in a way, I'm trying not to separate out those parts of myself."

Origin to release new album in July
May 8, 2014
<TEXT>
Genre defining technical death metal giants, Origin, will release Omnipresent on July 8, 2014 in North America via Nuclear Blast Records (and on Agonia Records on July 4th in Europe). Omnipresent was recorded with longtime producer/engineer Robert Rebeck at Chapman Recording in Lenexa, KS. The album was mixed and mastered at Menegroth - The Thousand Caves with Colin Marston, and features artwork once again by Colin Marks (Nevermore, Kataklysm, Exodus). Regarding the artwork, vocalist Jason Keyser explains:

"We were very happy to be able to work again with Colin Marks of Rain Song Design for the artwork of Omnipresent. He designed the art for our previous album, Entity, which had a barren, stripped down minimalism, but for Omnipresent we wanted bigger. We were looking for something that would represent the total insignificance and helplessness of humanity to the impending doom of the universe that surrounds us at all times. It's a strong running theme of the album lyrically; how our pride and arrogance can advance us as a species in so many ways, eventually conquering the unknown reaches of space. But ultimately we continue to exist only at the whim of the cold, indiscriminate forces that could snuff our sentient spark at any moment.

"The title of the album, Omnipresent, works perfectly with the artwork in the way that omnipresence does not come from expanding to new worlds and growing as a species, but only through being whittled down to a last living being alone in the universe. The final failed experiment of life has no comparison, it is the most powerful, only through our sentient extinction can we finally understand some sliver of godhood."

Omnipresent marks the recording debut of Jason Keyser (ex-Skinless), who has being touring with the Origin as their vocalist since the release of Entity. "Origin records albums in a somewhat masochistic, chaotic, and senseless fashion," comments drummer John Longstreth. "It's our best trick, and we need the best guy for our best trick, so that's why we have Jason. He's had two years of hard road work with the band and we know he's the guy. For those that weren't aware, Origin recorded Entity as a trio without a proper vocalist, so we are very excited to have Jason in to do what a proper vocalist is supposed to do."

Omnipresent track listing:

01. All Things Dead
02. THRALL:FULCRUM:APEX
03. Permanence
04. Manifest Desolate
05. Absurdity of What I Am
06. Source of Icon O
07. Continuum
08. Unattainable Zero
09. Redistribution of Filth
10. Obsolescence
11. Malthusian Collapse
12. The Indiscriminate
13. Kill Yourself (S.O.D. cover song)

"A culmination of 15 years of technical death metal brutality, Omnipresent transcends definition," states the band. "From light speed to absolute zero it is a journey to the farthest reaches of the universe to the darkest nether of the mind. We are everywhere and nowhere. We are omnipresent."

Porter Robinson Announces Album Release Date with New Single, 'Sad Machine'
May 13, 2014
<TEXT>
Emerging EDM artist Porter Robinson has revealed an Aug 12 release date for his debut album, Worlds, delivering second single "Sad Machine" in the process.
The song is a ballad-esque affair, featuring dreamy electronic blips and alternating robotic and human-like vocals.
"I didn't have much time before I had to turn in the entire album, so I just sang the male parts," Robinson said in a press release about the new track, the first to feature his own vocals. "I wanted something that felt distantly sad, a little cute, surreal, hopeful, and maybe somehow evocative of fiction? It's also peppered with cheap little general-midi interludes that sound like N64 games or old PC games. Those are so nostalgic to me and they really helped the whole thing feel all fantastical and fictional."
Worlds, which Robinson has called "my favorite thing I've ever done in my entire life," is already available for pre-order, with the first 500 vinyl pre-orders coming on limited edition translucent wax and hand-signed by Robinson himself. The first 500 CD pre-orders are printed with exclusive album art, also autographed by the artist.
The album pre-order will also direct fans towards an exclusive pre-sale access code for Robinson's upcoming live tour in support of Worlds. Tour details and dates are forthcoming.

Former Alaskan To Release New Album Friday
April 25, 2014
<TEXT>
Former Alaskan musician Seth Boyer will release his second full length album Half Lonely on Friday, April 25.

The album undisputedly reflects its title. Boyer's touching ability to create a scene both desperate and sweet is well captured here. The nine songs that make up Half Lonely are intimate, tactile and frankly constructed, spun together with threads of guilt, shame, destitution and regret, but also with the buoyancy of hope, honesty and determination.

Perhaps the grey skies of Seattle, Wash. and the heavy sweaters of Ballard have subsidized Boyer's brand of creativity? That's not exactly what the musician thinks is at play.

"Seattle has been great for my creative process and output – only two songs on the record were written in Alaska – but it's less to do with place and more to do with playing music full-time. Without an office job, all my energy goes toward songwriting/recording," Boyer wrote in an email Thursday. "I have a half-dozen songs that didn't make the record … I want to release more singles rather than build up this months-long flood of content and dump it all at once."

Boyer has been releasing loose singles on his Facebook page via Soundcloud routinely since relocating to Seattle in December of last year. Half Lonely marks his first new collection since 2012's Pre Exodus.

Pick up the album if you're a fan of artist like M. Ward, Jeff Buckley, Conor Oberst (Bright Eyes) and/or, you know, Seth Boyer. And check out two of the singles of the new album below:

Ahmad Jamal - Press Release - New Album - Saturday Morning
<TEXT>
Following on from Blue Moon, Ahmad Jamal and his dream team are back with his new CD "Saturday Morning" which will be released in September 2013. Produced by Jazzbook records and distributed by "harmonia mundi" / Jazz Village.

It is a joyful album made up of the kind of ballads to which only he holds the key. Each one is a moment of grace, shining like a star in the sky of American Classical Music. It features a wonderful Duke Ellington cover and a tribute to Horace Silver. With his light-fingered but rhythmic style, he sends us into a sensuous trance and leads us to a musical climax. A sound, which is pure groove.

Considering his ensemble "an orchestra", Mr. Jamal not only achieves a unified sound, but subtly inserts independent roles for the bass and drums. The hallmarks of Mr. Jamal's style are rhythmic innovations, colorful harmonic perceptions, especially left hand harmonic and melodic figures, plus parallel and contrary motion lines in and out of chordal substitutions and alterations and pedal point ostinato interludes in tasteful dynamics. He also incorporates a unique sense of space in his music, and his musical concepts are exciting without being loud in volume. Augmented by a selection of unusual standards and his own compositions, Mr. Jamal would notably impress and influence, among others, trumpeter Miles Davis. 
In 1994, Mr. Jamal received the American Jazz Masters fellowship award from the National Endowment for the Arts. The same year he was named a Duke Ellington Fellow at Yale University, where he performed commissioned works with the Assai String Quartet. 

In 2007 the French Government inducted Mr. Jamal into the prestigious Order of the Arts and Letters by French Culture Minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, naming him Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. 

Mr. Jamal's previous recording A Quiet Time (Dreyfus Records), released in January 2010, was the number #1 CD on jazz radio for the year 2010 and continues to soar. Also that same year the French Jazz Academy has voted "The Complete Ahmad Jamal Trio Argo Sessions 1956-1962" released by Mosaïc "Best reissue of the year with outstanding research work".

NEW ALBUM: NICK CAVE & THE BAD SEEDS 'PUSH THE SKY AWAY' - OUT FEB 2013
<TEXT>
Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds release their fifteenth studio album PUSH THE SKY AWAY on 18 February 2013
"Well, if I were to use that threadbare metaphor of albums being like children, then Push The Sky Away is the ghost-baby in the incubator and Warren's loops are its tiny, trembling heart-beat." Nick Cave
At the heart of Push the Sky Away is a naturalism and warmth that makes it the most subtly beautiful of all the Bad Seeds albums. The contemporary settings of myths, and the cultural references that have time-stamped Nick's songs of the twenty-first century mist lightly through details drawn from the life he observed around his seaside home, through the tall windows on the album's mysterious and ambiguous cover.
The songs on this album took form in a modest notebook with shellac covers over the course of almost a year. The notebook is a treasured analogue artefact but the internet is equally important to Nick: Googling curiosities, being entranced by exotic Wikipedia entries "whether they're true or not". These songs convey how on the internet profoundly significant events, momentary fads and mystically-tinged absurdities sit side-by-side and question how we might recognise and assign weight to what's genuinely important.
Push the Sky Away was produced by Nick Launay and recorded at La Fabrique, a recording studio based in a 19th Century mansion in the South of France, where the walls of the main studio are lined with an immense collection of classical vinyl.
"I enter the studio with a handful of ideas, unformed and pupal; it's the Bad Seeds that transform them into things of wonder. Ask anyone who has seen them at work. They are unlike any other band on earth for pure, instinctive inventiveness." Nick Cave
On this album it's not always apparent what instruments the band is playing: they may be traditional musical instruments but other sounds are clearly generated by objects unrelated to musical instruments. What's being created is a collective musical language that's rich and complex.
Push the Sky Away has a clarity and sweet strangeness that's built upon the refusal to accept limitations, whether they be the traditional uses and sounds of musical instruments, lyric styles, or diminished spiritual horizons.
"I don't know, this record just seems new, you know, but new in an old school kind of way" Nick Cave
Track one "We No Who U R" is  available  from 3 December as a download with every pre-order album purchase via nickcave.com or iTunes.
The track will also be available as a single download from all digital retailers.

Matisyahu to Release New Album Akeda in June
March 26, 2014
<TEXT>
Matisyahu has announced that he will be releasing his fifth LP on June 3 via Elm City Music. Yesterday, Matisyahu dropped the lyric video for his new single "Watch the Walls Melt Down" along with the cover art and tracklist for his new album, which he titled Akeda.

Akeda was recorded in Brooklyn at Studio G with producer Stu Brooks (50 Cent, Norah Jones) and Joel Hamilton (Pretty Lights, Elvis Costello). Matisyahu mainly wrote his new 15-song album in Los Angeles and while he was on tour.

"This record and period of my life deal with madness, listening for and following the inner intuitive voice, a small still sound," Matisyahu stated in a press release. "The record deals with love, with feelings of brokenness and humility, with humanity, struggle and sacrifice." The album will also feature duet performances with reggae singer Collie Buddz and hip-hop artist Zion I.

Matisyahu's new album, Akeda is available for pre-order now on his website or in the iTunes store. You can view the cover art and tracklist below.
