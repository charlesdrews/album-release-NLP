NEW ALBUM PRESS RELEASE
<TEXT>
On May 20th, HAMMERFALL is going to release their new album called Infected.  Laying down the foundation themselves in their own studio in Sweden, the band then traveled to Nashville, TN, to finish it up with acclaimed producer James Michael (MÖTLEY CRÜE, SCORPIONS, MEAT LOAF). He also mixed the album, giving it a decisive updated edge without losing anything of the essence of the band. "James helped us create something that was new and exciting while still in the line of our heritage", Oscar Dronjak, guitar player and founder of the band, explains.

"Never before have we sounded this fresh and up to date without losing the essence of what HammerFall is all about: Pure 'Infected' Heavy Metal!", comments vocalist and frontman Joacim Cans.

You will experience us like you've never done before! We've got a lot of fresh influences shining through in the music, but everything you love about HammerFall will still be there", says Oscar. "This is HammerFall in 2011, the legend has been reborn!".

On March 12th, the music was introduced for the first time to an international group of press people in Göteborg, where the album received a great response. Metal Hammer Spain calls it "the HammerFall of the future", while British Powerplay Magazine comments: "Infected will have the name HammerFall spreading like a virus. Prepare for an epidemic!". The album consists eleven songs, and the limited first edition will also include a bonus DVD with unreleased video material of five of the Infected tracks.

A compete track listing of the album reads as follows:

Patient Zero
B.Y.H.
One More Time
The Outlaw
Send Me A Sign
Dia De Los Muertos
I Refuse
666 – The Enemy Within
Immortalized
Let's Get It On
Redemption

?The first single will be One More Time, released on April 6th, digital only. A video will be shot by Patrick Ullaeus, who is also responsible for the cover artwork of Infected.

XSCAPE: NEW MICHAEL JACKSON ALBUM
March 31,2014
<TEXT>
It was announced today that on May 13th Epic Records, in conjunction with the Estate of Michael Jackson, will release XSCAPE, an album of new music by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. XSCAPE is executive produced by Epic Records Chairman and CEO L.A. Reid. After mining by the Estate of Jackson's archives, Reid was granted unlimited access to the treasures spanning four decades of material on which Jackson had completed his vocals. Reid then teamed up top producers to "contemporize" the songs while retaining Jackson's essence and integrity, creating the best music you've never heard.
The list of producers include global hitmakers Timbaland, Rodney Jerkins, Stargate and John McClain.

The new album will feature eight brand new recordings. A Deluxe Edition of XSCAPE will include a selection of the recordings in their original form. Both the standard and Deluxe Edition's are available April 1st for pre-order on iTunes and elsewhere.

The title of this album honors Michael's album naming process. He always chose a song from the album to name his projects and, beginning with THRILLER, used only one word titles, each with an edgy quality to them. This is true of the new project.

John Branca and John McClain, co-executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson said, "Michael was always on the cutting edge and was constantly reaching out to new producers, looking for new sounds. He was always relevant and current. These tracks, in many ways, capture that spirit. We thank L.A. Reid for his vision."

GARBAGE ANNOUNCE FIRST NEW ALBUM IN SEVEN YEARS
January 30, 2012
<TEXT>
Garbage has announced that their fifth studio album, Not Your Kind Of People, will be released in the United States on May 15, 2012, on the band's label STUNVOLUME.  As V Magazine recently put it:  "The poster girl for '90s alternative rock is ready to reclaim her reign - and the radio - with a new record from her iconic band, Garbage."

"Working with Garbage again was very instinctual," said Duke Erikson.  "Like getting on a bicycle…with three other people."   He adds "We haven't felt this good about a Garbage record since the last one!"

Garbage - Shirley Manson (vocals), Steve Marker (guitars, keyboards), Duke Erikson (guitars, keyboards) and Butch Vig (drums, loops) - will hit the road this spring in support of the album by performing several headlining shows as well as various festivals throughout Europe and the U.S. with more dates to be confirmed. 
"Thinking about going back on the road is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measure," said Shirley Manson. "………but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure."

PRESS RELEASE: NEW SCOTT STAPP SOLO ALBUM COMING SOON!
September 24, 2013
<TEXT>
Grammy-Award winning artist Scott Stapp releases the deeply personal Proof of Life on Wind-up Records, November 5, 2013.  Proof of Life was produced by Howard Benson and mixed by Chris Lord-Alge and is Stapp's second solo album; his first was 2005's certified platinum, The Great Divide.  On October 8, 2013 the reflective "Slow Suicide" will go to radio, be available digitally and several pre-order options will also be offered on Stapp's website.

Proof of Life is Stapp's first new material since the release of his 2012 uncensored memoir, Sinner's Creed  which Stapp shared his life story for the first time—from his fundamentalist upbringing, the rise of Creed, and his ongoing battle with addiction, the rediscovery of his faith, and the launch of his solo career.  The gripping memoir is "proof" positive for Stapp that a higher power is always present, despite the colossal messes we sometimes make of our lives.  Proof of Life is an 11-track collection of songs that chronicles the extension of his journey.

"This is the most meaningful record of my career," says Stapp. "I've made a lot of messes in my life but I've learned I can take a mess and turn it into a message. This album chronicles my struggles, my journey and it's the most honest record I have ever written.  The fans have always meant everything to me and over the years they've come to me and told me how through my music they've gotten through the worst of times and that hit me.  With this album, it's the first time that when I listened back to the tracks, it became a cathartic experience for me."

The new songs reflect the maturity and wisdom of an artist that has sold nearly 30 million albums with Creed, had three Grammy nominations and one win for Best Rock Song with "With Arms Wide Open," and 11 #1 Singles with "My Own Prison," "Torn," "What's This Life For," "One," "Higher," "What If," "Are You Ready," "With Arms Wide Open," "My Sacrifice" "One Last Breath," and "Overcome."  Creed put out six albums - My Own Prison (1997) 6x Platinum, Human Clay (1999) 11+ million (Diamond), Weathered (2001) 6x Platinum, Greatest Hits (2004) 2x Platinum and Full Circle (2009) Certified Gold.

Press Release: Atash releases long-awaited 3rd album, Everything Is Music
February 23, 2014
<TEXT>
Austin's multi-award winning world music band, Atash, shall release their long-awaited 3rd album, Everything Is Music, worldwide on March 25, 2014, featuring the pan-cultural alchemy of sound the group is so famous for, and incorporating heavyweight musicians from the worlds's stage such as world jazz guitarist Fareed Haque, Uzbek doira (frame drum) master Abbos Kosimov, and tabla maestro Subrata Bhattacharya along with fellow local indie Indo-rock songstress Naga Valli and members of the Haitian boys' choir Les Petits Chanteurs.  In one sense, the album is over a decade in the making, in that it is the international collective's first studio album since their 2003 debut, republic of love, itself the winner of an Austin Music Award in 2004.  Everything Is Music captures some of the live essence of the band, reflecting the closer telepathic connection between the musicians that has been earned through many diverse experiences over its long career.

As ambassadors of the world to Austin, and ambassadors of Austin to the world, Atash has racked up a lot of experience in its nearly 18 year history (counting the group's late 90s incarnation, The Gypsies).  Called "Austin's best-kept secret" by the Austin Chronicle as early as 1998, from the beginning the concoction of Middle Eastern strings, Indian percussion and flamenco harmonies behind the exquisitely passionate Persian vocals of Mohammad Firoozi generated a buzz in the Live Music Capital of the World, from the scenes created around the Gypsies' 1998-9 weekly residency at the old Mercury Lounge (former White Rabbit) to the nine-year weekly run of Atash at the warehouse district's Red Fez, spanning from 2002 to its closing in 2011.  In its longevity, the group has enjoyed the talents of many great musicians within its ranks, from Gypsies co-founder Oliver Rajamani, and other Gypsies cohorts cellist John Pointer, and guitarists Joey de Lago and Glenn Rexach, to Atash-era flamenco guitarist Christian Fernandez (formerly frontman of the now-defunct, but wildly-popular-in-its-time Ta Mère) and Carolyn Wonderland drummer Rob Hooper.  However, reincarnated as Atash in 2001, the group has been on a trajectory in which most members have stayed, and the group has only grown, from the original five-piece to a nine-piece that sometimes may sprawl to an even larger size with guest artist.  In any case the group has evolved into an unbreakable brotherhood of musicians from different musical backgrounds, creeds, and cultures.  In the last 13 years, Atash has traversed the globe, touring the United States, Mexico, Spain, and Taiwan, multiple times and gained devoted fans at every turn, and it has also become the foremost representation of world music in its native Austin, earning the Austin Music Award for Best World Music Band every year since 2007.

The album took shape over 3 years, beginning with a songwriting retreat in January of 2010, in the lush two-story Victorian house which is Troubadour Studios in Lockhart, run by engineer Steven Collins (Deadman), where some tracks were recorded months later.  However, facing several stalls due to the migrations of band members, scheduling snafus and financial challenges, most of the tracks were recorded in the more austere but fully decked-out studio The Still, in southwest Austin, with engineer Randall Squires, and was mastered at Tonehaus in east Austin by Thomas van der Brook.  The album represents a maturation of the quintet of Mohammad Firoozi, Jason McKenzie, Roberto Riggio, Dylan Jones, and John Moon, heard on republic of love, and an even more collaborative approach than they have done previously, adding the collaborative talents of sitarist Indrajit Banerjee, west African percussionist Aboubacar Sylla, and the flamenco guitar of the band's newest member, Cuban-born Jose Manuel Tejeda, along with that and the singing of outgoing guitarist Fernandez, who returned to his native southern France in the summer of 2010.  Firoozi's exquisite vocals and mystical poetry in Farsi proclaim the power of love, borrowing at times from great Sufi mystic poets of the early centuries of the last millenium, Rumi and Saadi, whose famous poem "Bani Adam," ("Children of Adam") used on the track "Sahara Spring," rhapsodizes upon the brotherhood of all human beings.  Textures of rock; Indian, Arabic and western classical music; reggae; qawwali; west African griot; and flamenco are interwoven seamlessly on this most recent, and best, effort to date by this powerhouse of world music in Austin.

Having just returned from successful first time visits to Hawaii and New York, Atash is in full gear preparing for its SXSW showcase at Russian House on March 12, CD release theatrical performances at Stateside at the Paramount in Austin March 21 and 22, and summer west and east coast tours.

Press Release: New Album 'Fun On Earth' & 'The Lot' Collection Released in October
August 15, 2013
<TEXT>
Roger Taylor, legendary rock icon and full-throttle drumming powerhouse, has confirmed the release of his fifth studio album 'Fun On Earth' in October alongside 'The Lot', the complete collection of his rich back catalogue of work spanning his solo career and material from The Cross, in stunning limited collectors editions and digital formats.

'Fun on Earth' is one of Taylor's most exciting and accomplished pieces of work to date.  Recorded at Priory Studios, Surrey, the 13 track album is a triumphant display of superior musicianship showcasing Taylor at his vocal best.  'Say It's Not True' sees Taylor team up with Jeff Beck for the contemporary Queen favourite while the smooth refrains and heartfelt lyrics of 'Woman You're So Beautiful' and 'Be With You' come together with the powerful, reckless spirit of opening track 'One Night Stand' and 'I Am The Drummer (In A Rock n' Roll Band)' on what is an exhilarating, tour de force of rock music. 

In an interview with Classic Rock Taylor says of the new album: "My first solo effort (in 1981) was called Fun in Space. Ive called this one Fun On Earth.  I've come down to earth a bit, but there's still a bit of fun in there - some smiley tracks.  It's been written over a five year period, so it's very eclectic.  Some gentle stuff, some rockier stuff, and some fairly political stuff."

With a juggernaut career spanning six decades, Taylor was the beating heart of Queen penning landmark hits 'Radio Ga Ga', 'A Kind of Magic' and 'Days of Our Lives' while enjoying success across the globe with accomplished solo material which reached the heights of the UK charts.  A true rock icon, 'Fun on Earth' proves that Taylor is still performing at the top of his game and with a body of work behind him that speaks for itself, 'The Lot' is a must-have collectors item for any discerning music lover.  

Taylor has also been working with The Queen Extravaganza, the official Queen tribute band, who are coming to the UK for the first time this October.  Having achieved resounding success in North America, the spectacular touring concert has already had to add more dates to its debut UK tour due to phenomenal demand.  The show is designed to take the glorious music and live experience of Queen and bring it to a new generation of fans - full tour dates below.  

Full details of 'Fun on Earth' and 'The Lot' including release date and tracklisting will be announced in the coming weeks.

Press Release: Greg Laswell Announces New Album "Landline" To Be Released April 24
<TEXT>
Producer, singer, songwriter Greg Laswell is proud to announce the release of his newest full-length LP, Landline, to be released April 24th on Vanguard Records. Landline is Laswell's first album since 2010's Take A Bow, and his fourth full-length. Laswell, a talented producer and musician in his own right, self-produced the record. For full album track listing, please see below.
Landline's 11 new tracks were recorded by Laswell in a church-turned-house in a small lobstering town in down-east Maine. Laswell's nomadic tendencies caused him to relocate from Los Angeles to New York City, eventually ending up at the church-turned-house that is owned by his wife's parents. The album's title was inspired by the fact that the home-recording-studio had no cell-phone reception, forcing Laswell to use landlines for all of his calls.
The album features collaborations with a number of well-known female singers, including Ingrid Michaelson, Sia, Elizabeth Ziman (of Elizabeth and the Catapult) and Sara Bareilles (on the album's lead single 'Come Back Down.') Inspired by hip-hop records that he was listening to while writing and recording the album, Laswell decided he wanted to work with and feature female vocals alongside his own. Each singer brings a new element and personality to the songs, whether it's Bareilles' energy that caused Laswell to need to re-record his vocals, or the fact that he co-wrote the album's title track with Ingrid Michaelson when the power went out one night.
Laswell's songs have won over several of film and television's top music supervisors, who have featured his songs in films such as Friends With Benefits and My Sister's Keeper, and television placements in the season premieres of CBS' NCIS and NBC's Parenthood, as well as ten individual placements on ABC's hit drama Grey's Anatomy.

NEW BOB DYLAN ALBUM – TEMPEST - SET FOR SEPTEMBER RELEASE
July 17, 2012
<TEXT>
Columbia Records announced today that Bob Dylan's new studio album, Tempest, will be released on September 11, 2012. Featuring ten new and original Bob Dylan songs, the release of Tempest coincides with the 50th Anniversary of the artist's eponymous debut album, which was released by Columbia in 1962.

Tempest is available for pre-order now on iTunes and Amazon. The new album, produced by Jack Frost, is the 35thth studio set from Bob Dylan, and follows 2009's worldwide best-seller, Together Through Life.

Bob Dylan's four previous studio albums have been universally hailed as among the best of his storied career, achieving new levels of commercial success and critical acclaim for the artist. The Platinum-selling Time Out Of Mind from 1997 earned multiple Grammy Awards, including Album Of The Year, while "Love and Theft" continued Dylan's Platinum streak and earned several Grammy nominations and a statue for Best Contemporary Folk album.

Modern Times, released in 2006, became one of the artist's most popular albums, selling more than 2.5 million copies worldwide and earning Dylan two more Grammys. Together Through Life became the artist's first album to debut at #1 in both the U.S. and the UK, as well as in five other countries, on its way to surpassing sales of one million copies.

Those four releases fell within a 12-year creative span that also included the recording of an Oscar- and Golden Globe-winning composition, "Things Have Changed," from the film Wonder Boys, in 2001; a worldwide best-selling memoir, Chronicles Vol. 1, which spent 19 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List, in 2004, and a Martin Scorsese-directed documentary, No Direction Home, in 2005. Bob Dylan also released his first collection of holiday standards, Christmas In The Heart, in 2009, with all of the artist's royalties from that album being donated to hunger charities around the world.

This year, Bob Dylan was the recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor. He was awarded a special Pulitzer Prize in 2008 for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power." He was also the recipient of the French Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 1990, Sweden's Polar Music Award in 2000 and several Doctorates including the University of St. Andrews and Princeton University as well as numerous other honors.

Tempest is available for pre-order now on iTunes and Amazon.

PRESS RELEASE: Integrity Music Releases Love Stands Forever, Debut Worship Album from Northern Ireland's Nathan Jess
May 21, 2013
<TEXT>
Integrity Music announces the global release of Love Stands Forever, the debut album from Nathan Jess, a worship leader and songwriter based in Northern Ireland.
 
Rich in poetic beauty and packed with truth and insight into the walk of faith, Love Stands Forever offers 12 new songs including the popular UK single "I Am Redeemed."  The album was produced by Dan Wheeler (Tim Hughes/Graham Kendrick/BBC) and includes co-writes with Rend Collective's Chris Llewellyn and Worship Central's Luke Hellebronth and Nick Herbert among others.
 
Songs like "No Limit To Your Love" and "Burning Heart" share the same DNA as stadium anthems, but without ever stepping away from simple arrangements and acoustic instruments. Others, like "Broken Hallelujah" and "Lead Me Home," manage to present vulnerable honesty and divine-fueled optimism in the same breath.  And "I Am Redeemed" takes the worshipper on a journey from the garden of Gethsemane, through the agony of the cross all the way up to the fullness of life today. It is a song that proclaims redemption in Christ, boldly and confidently. 
 

The complete track list for Love Stands Forever is:
1.   No Limit To Your Love
2.   Burning Heart
3.   God Is Love
4.   Be My Obsession
5.   I Am Redeemed
6.   Lead Me Home
7.   When All Your Mercies
8.   Come Lord Jesus, Quickly Come
9.   Forever and Always
10. Broken Hallelujah
11. My Jesus
12. Prayer 

*A video for "When All Your Mercies" is available at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrBCpsdGn3U.
 
Jess, who majored in music/composition at Belfast's Queens University, marries the singer/songwriter aesthetic with the heart of a worship leader while always striving for congregational accessibility.

"I honed my craft starting off as a singer/songwriter who was also leading worship, then the light came on in my head and I found that the fusion of the two was what I was really passionate about… writing congregational worship songs." 
 
From that "light bulb moment" on, Jess hasn't stopped as he's been busy working with other worshipers including Rend Collective and Ben Cantelon, both of whom he's supported on tour. And on May 25 & 26, Jess will appear at the British "Big Church Day Out" event, leading worship for thousands of festival-goers. For more information, visit http://www.nathanjess.com.
 
Love Stands Forever is available globally through all major digital service providers, including iTunes and Amazon.

Folk Rock band Rye to release new album, Cumberland Island, on May 14
March 30, 2013
<TEXT>
Atlanta band Rye will independently release Cumberland Island on May 14, 2013. Featuring the brotherly harmonies of David and Jonathan Fallis, Cumberland Island is a modern blend of folk rock with crisp songwriting and warm instrumentation that draws on shades of Americana, country, and soul. At times, it's James Taylor, while at others, it's the Heartbreakers; but at its core, it is Rye.

Cumberland Island was recorded to 2 inch analog tape at Fry Pharmacy Studios in Nashville. The album was mastered analog as well at Treelady Studios by Garrett Haines, a frequent contributor to Tape Op Magazine. The decision to record, mix, and master entirely analog was intentional, "We intended to keep our personality in this record, and didn't want to give ourselves a chance to lose that intimacy through over-editing," says David Fallis. The album Cumberland Island was recorded with mostly live vocals and with limited overdubs.

Rye began their run of 2013 shows in an unconventional manner, collaborating to play two nights with a live ballet set to the band's music. And for a band that's keen on storytelling, pairing with live dance was a natural fit. "Adding a visual element to our songs was special. It really gave them a new perspective," remarks Jonathan Fallis. "We are always looking for new ways to connect our songs with an audience."

Rye will be playing live shows in support of Cumberland Island throughout 2013. The album will be available digitally and through physical CD on the release date, May 14. Full show dates, additional media, and Rye's complete biography can be found at http://www.RyeTheBand.com.

Press Release: Cilantro Boombox (Self-Titled Album) 
<TEXT>
Fueled by a successful Kickstarter Campaign, Cilantro Boombox is releasing its self-titled debut album. The 
grassroots approach in the production of the album had members of the band and collaborators recording anywhere 
from apartments to hot storage rooms. But don't let that fool you, the album, produced by Felix Pacheco counts on 
collaborations from many talented and well known musicians in the Austin scene as well as artists like Frank Orrall 
(Poi Dog Pondering and Thievery Corporation) and Grammy Award Winner, Adrian Quesada (Grupo Fantasma & 
Brownout) who lent his mixing talents. 
 
Cilantro Boombox's melting pot of sounds and influences shape a very original and dynamic collection of tracks. 
The album contains 11 songs that borrow from Latin and Venezuelan rhythms, rock, disco, funk, hip-hop and even 
second line jazz; all the while maintaining a common sound and electronic vibe that gives Cilantro Boombox its 
unique sound. From the socially charged lyrics in songs like "La Batalla" to light hearted ones and a few 
instrumental tracks, this record aims for one thing, "to make people dance". Poi Dog Pondering's Frank Orrall's 
distinctive voice surrounds the listener in the deeply grooving "All Around". The band has chosen the disco inspired 
"Last Call" as the first single of the album. 
 
In Cilantro Boombox's short life, the band, lead by Bassist/DJ/Producer, Felix Pacheco, has been able to position 
itself as strong up and coming act, playing shows with Nickodemus, Ursula 1000, Ocote Soul Sounds and Latin 
Grammy winner, Los Amigos Invisibles. This album aims to take that to the next level, with shows planned to 
support it in the fall and winter 2013. Starting with a CD release party September 14th at Hotel Vegas in Austin, TX.

OKP News: The Roots Officially Announce Release of New LP undun
<TEXT>
This morning The Roots officially announced the December 6th release of their new LP undun on Island Def Jam. A sort of novel in audio form, undun is "an existential re-telling of the short life of one Redford Stephens (1974-1999)." In some ways the culmination of the play between street legal rap and high art that has always characterized The Roots' music the record explores "the intersection of free will and prescribed destiny as it plays out on the corner," beginning with Redford's death and moving backwards in time to deconstruct all that has led to his (and our own) coming "undun." Or as The Roots' drummer and spokesman Ahmir "?uestlove" Thompson puts it:
"At this point in our career we'd like for our work to have a unifying theme, and an experiential quality. We've been intentionally making our albums shorter in length so that they can be experienced as a continuous work. The music is band-oriented with an eye on the moody cinematic. As a DJ, I am the King of playlists, but I don't want our albums to feel like a playlist or a mixtape for that matter. We want to tell stories that work within the album format and we want the stories to be nuanced and useful to people. Undun is the story of this kid who becomes criminal, but he wasn't born criminal. He's not the nouveau exotic primitive bug-eyed gunrunner like Tupac's character Bishop in Juice… he's actually thoughtful and is neither victim nor hero. Just some kid who begins to order his world in a way that makes the most sense to him at a given moment… At the end of the day… isn't that what we all do?"
See our accompanying post to catch the World Premiere of the first leak "Make My" featuring Big K.R.I.T.  "Make My" hits iTunes November 1st and The Roots will be playing New York's Highline Ballroom on Nov. 29th-30th and again on Dec. 5th Dec. 6th to launch the album with a bang. Get the full tracklist after the jump and stay tuned for more!

JOSÉ JAMES ANNOUNCES NEW ALBUM "WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING" OUT JUNE 10
March 18, 2014
<TEXT>
Jose James has announced a June 10 release date for his new album, While You Were Sleeping, his fifth studio album and his second album for Blue Note Records. While You Were Sleeping is the follow-up to his widely acclaimed R&B and jazz steeped No Beginning No End, and signals a new creative direction for the versatile singer-songwriter. The album was recorded in Brooklyn, NY, and was produced by Jose and Brian Bender, Pre-order now on Amazon or iTunes. Stream the album's first single "EveryLittleThing" at NPR Music.

That creative shift is heard in the rock edge of tracks like "EveryLittleThing" and "Anywhere U Go" and is evidenced in a change in Jose's band which adds guitarist Brad Allen Williams to the stellar line-up of keyboardist Kris Bowers, bassist Solomon Dorsey and drummer Richard Spaven. The influence of Jimi Hendrix can be heard throughout the album as much as R&B forefathers like Al Green. Special guests on While You Were Sleeping include vocalist Becca Stevens who duets with James on her song "Dragon," as well as trumpeter Takuya Kuroda who is featured on the cover of Green's classic "Simply Beautiful" that closes the album.

"This album is a synthesis of everything I love about music," says Jose, "from contemporary artists like Frank Ocean, James Blake, and Junip to groundbreaking artists I grew up with like Nirvana, Radiohead, and Madlib. It's also a love letter to many late nights spent in East London clubs like Plastic People and Cargo, watching new movements unfold in electronic music. I want people to feel the joy of discovery that I experience night after night onstage, reaching for something new."

NPR Music raved about No Beginning No End, proclaiming "James makes utterly contemporary music," adding that he "skirts categories with ease, fitting in with current R&B innovators like Frank Ocean or Miguel, yet maintaining a strong awareness of a lineage that stretches from Ray Charles to Marvin Gaye to Lou Rawls to Maxwell."

Pitchfork noted that "While he's always been one to try stuff out – he successfully collaborated with Flying Lotus on Blackmagic – on No Beginning No End he finds a way to make an eclectic approach feel unified and whole. With previous releases, he's earned his heroic acclaim in the tough, tried-and-trusted lanes of contemporary jazz. With No Beginning No End, he's built his own road out."

Jose has also announced a short run of April U.S. tour dates to preview songs from While You Were Sleeping. The tour kicks off April 15 in Philadelphia and makes stops in Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. He has also announced album release shows in New York (Highline Ballroom, June 12) and Los Angeles (Playboy Jazz Festival, June 15). More dates will be announced shortly.

NEW ALBUM OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE
March 20, 2014
<TEXT>
After selling more than 15 million albums, scoring 28 No. 1 hits, earning three GRAMMY® Awards and more than 40 Dove Awards, musical icon Michael W. Smith will open a new chapter in his career on May 13 as he releases Sovereign, his first studio worship album since 2008 and his first album with new label partner Sparrow Records and Capitol Christian Music Group. Sovereign will also be available as a Deluxe Edition, which will include a special DVD concert filmed at Smith's barn in Franklin, Tenn. and will feature guest appearances from Kari Jobe and Leeland Mooring. The DVD will also include special behind the scenes footage and content with Smith discussing the inspiration behind Sovereign.
Well known as one of the most gifted artists and worship leaders of his generation, Smith's previous worship projects have sold well over 3.5 million albums. Throughout the entirety of his career, Smith's albums have received one Double Platinum, seven Platinum and 16 Gold RIAA Certifications. However, not one to rest on past success as he hits the "sweet spot" of his career, Smith is deliberately entering a new creative chapter on Sovereign, crafting a vibrant collection of vertically-focused songs with a fresh sense of musical innovation.
"I'm enjoying making music more than I ever have in my entire life," Smith exudes. "I'm having fun and I'm excited about this record and this next chapter."
In the spirit of this new adventure, Smith enlisted the talents of several songwriters and producers he hasn't collaborated with previously for Sovereign, including Seth Moseley (Newsboys, Sanctus Real, Love & the Outcome) and Kyle Lee (Natalie Grant). Smith also tapped the expertise of producers Chris Stevens (TobyMac, Carrie Underwood, Mandisa) and West Coast-based writer/producer Jeremy Edwardson (Kari Jobe, Jesus Culture). Bridging the gap between a generation of worship leaders, Smith brought in one of his favorite singers, Kari Jobe, to sing on a track.
"You Won't Let Go," the first single from Sovereign, has quickly become a staple in Smith's live shows. The song has also given Smith a triumphant reentry to Christian radio where it was immediately the most added at Christian AC, and currently sits at No. 22 on the National Christian Audience chart. The lyric video for the track can be seen herehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRb_NIQTzyA.

Echo & The Bunnymen Return With New Album And Tour
February 24, 2014
<TEXT>
Legendary Liverpool band Echo & the Bunnymen are putting the finishing touches on their 12th studio album and first since 2009, Meteorites, which will be released April 28th in the UK on 429 Records and distributed by Caroline.  The album will also be released by 429 Records in the U.S. on June 3rd.   Produced by Youth (Killing Joke, The Verve), the album contains ten hand-picked new songs written by founder Ian McCulloch and performed by Bunnymen stalwarts McCulloch and Will Sergeant along with Gordy Goudie (guitar) and Stephen Brannan (bass).  In conjunction with the album's release, the band will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK beginning in May (see confirmed dates below). 

Formed in 1978, the Bunnymen have been a vital force in the indie rock world for over 36 years having won over millions of obsessive music fans worldwide and indelibly influenced countless bands with their signature sound—from the Flaming Lips to Coldplay to Pavement. Meteorites is a key addition to their repertoire. It's an intimate song cycle written by Ian McCulloch performed by the band with a renewed sense of purpose showcasing all of their unmistakable musical hallmarks while taking them to a new level.

Says McCulloch: "'Meteorites', the new Bunnymen album... at long last we've made the worthy successor to 'Crocodiles,' 'Heaven Up Here,' 'Porcupine' and 'Ocean Rain.' 'Meteorites' is what Echo and the Bunnymen mean and are meant to be—up there in heaven--untouchable, celestial, beautiful and real.  It has changed my life."

Laibach
Release new album 'SPECTRE' – out 3 March. Reveal album trailer and new song, 'Resistance Is Futile'.
<TEXT>
LAIBACH release a brand new album, SPECTRE, on CD, vinyl and download on 3 March 2014. The deluxe edition of the album will come with four extra tracks plus the SPECTRE Partybook: a laminated linen bound party membership book with SPECTRE's manifesto and an invite to register your allegiance to its thesis.

SPECTRE follows the band's widely acclaimed conceptual album VOLK (2006) – where Laibach interpreted national anthems of historically imperialistic nations – and the release of the side projects LAIBACHKUNSTDERFUGE (2008) and IRON SKY: The Original Film Soundtrack (2012), watch a trailer for the new album here:
SPECTRE's release will be followed by a worldwide tour, which includes dates at KOKO, London as well as the band's first foray into China: a live date on 22 March will be preceded by a Laibach Kunst exhibition (17 January-20 March), plus a Laibach Seminar at the City University of Hong Kong on 21 March.
Laibach has once again 're-invented' itself in a newly born, yet polished and solid, formation. And, as is now customary, Laibach calls into question all the rigid and cemented interpretations (and prejudices) about itself, about its music, intentions, philosophy and ideology. Laibach are masters of escape, true escape artists. And yet, despite everything, SPECTRE resonates as a real and full-blooded Laibachian work and nothing else.

With SPECTRE Laibach has created a big, important, and almost dangerous step forward; it seems that this time it has fatally crossed the Rubicon. On this album the group – which has never defined itself politically, but has, nevertheless, constantly analysed politics through its work – comes across as politically engaged as never before. SPECTRE literally sounds like a political manifesto manifest in poetic form. Titles and lyrics couldn't be more direct. With these lyrics and songs, Laibach, who has always given a controversial impression – or an impression of controversy – especially in terms of its political orientation, is now very clearly taking a position on the political spectrum and probably irreversibly abolishing its own (to some extent quite comfortable) political 'freedom' and neutrality.

The album opens with The Whistleblowers, a contagiously optimistic piece of classic "militant & symphonic" Laibach, sounding like the sequel to Lieutenant F. J. Ricketts's 1914 "Colonel Bogey March". This rousing whistle along track – "From North and South / We come from East and West / Breathing as one / Living in fame / Or dying in flame"" alludes to the heroism of the new, 'digital' Prometheans of freedom – Bradley Manning, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange.

No History, knows no mercy, and leaves no doubt: Laibach require uncompromising action, they demand bravery and boldness and seek heroes "who will be the creed of a new political faith". And, in one of the verses of this song, listeners can find a mini-'manifesto' about the album itself, its sonic expression, and the position of the group in relation to its own history.

In amongst these rallying calls from the band, sits a rare Laibach love song: We Are Millions And Millions Are One deals with love in today's impossible times, times which are dangerously close to the fictional reality of classic anti-utopian novels such as Yevgeny Zamyatin's We (Мы), Laibach's inspiration for this song.

Ending the album is the elegant utopian song Koran a track that shows the possibility of a better and fairer world – on Earth or in the hereafter. Koran – which literally means 'recitation' (also another key Laibachian trait) –, of course, to some extent also refers to the series of uprisings, revolutions and wars in the Arab world that have been taking place in the past few years and which refuse to sink. Consequently, the album ends with the (in)complete, open, unfinished sound of a piano key…

'The Dark Side Of The Moon' 30th Anniversary edition reissued on Hybrid SACD in 5.1 surround sound
2003
<TEXT>
On 24th March 2003, EMI Records are pleased to announce the release of Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' on Super Audio CD (SACD) format, to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the title. This marks the first time Pink Floyd's seminal recording will be presented in full 5.1 surround sound.
'The Dark Side Of The Moon' has had a phenomenal impact since it was first released on 24th March, 1973. Widely acknowledged as one of the greatest British rock albums of all time, 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' remains a truly extraordinary recording, notching up sales in excess of a staggering 30 million worldwide to date.
To create the first 5.1 surround sound mix of 'The Dark Side Of The Moon', long time Pink Floyd producer/engineer James Guthrie utilized the 16-track tapes from the original recording sessions, remastering the tracks on custom-built electronics before final transferring to SACD format. The results are hugely impressive, retaining the spellbinding atmosphere of the original analog recordings whilst faithfully capturing the full dynamic evocative range of Pink Floyd's intricately layered music.
The listener will have two disc layers to choose from. The first layer contains the album playable on any CD system. The second includes a high resolution stereo version, plus a 5.1 surround sound mix that plays on SACD-compatible DVD players and home theatre systems. Both layers employ SACD's Direct Stream Digital (DSD) encoding process that samples the music 64 times faster than CD for unprecedented sound quality.
The 30th Anniversary release of 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' will be presented with a newly artworked prism, created by original sleeve artist and renowned designer, Storm Thorgerson.
The vinyl album will have the original prism on a black background cover, and will include the two posters and sticker postcard as per the original release.

PRESS RELEASE: Atomic Skunk's new album, Alchemy drops Friday, April 22 (Earth Day)
<TEXT>
Atomic Skunk's new album, Alchemy drops Friday, April 22 (Earth Day).

San Francisco Bay Area based electronic musician Rich Brodsky, aka Atomic Skunk, will release a new album entitled Alchemy on Earth Day, April 22, 2011. The album features 7 all new original tracks, including an epic drone piece, over 24 minutes in length entitled, "Temple of Stars." Alchemy is Brodsky's third album, following on the heels of his first two critically acclaimed releases, Binary Scenes and Portal. 

Atomic Skunk made a splash on the ambient electronic scene in 2009 with the release of Binary Scenes, garnering high praise from electronic music fans, bloggers and ambient music stalwarts such as Hearts of Space producer, Stephen Hill and Echoes Radio producer, John Dilberto, who described the music as "note perfect ambient, full of mood, unusual dreamstate shifts and psychedelic edges." Echoes Radio listeners voted Binary Scenes one of the "Top 200 CDs of the last 20 Years." Portal was a featured album on numerous, legendary ambient music radio programs such as Hearts of Space, Echoes Radio, SOMA FM, Musical Starstreams and Radioio Ambient. Echoes Radio listeners voted it into the Top 25 for the "2010 Best of Echoes Radio" listeners poll, while the staff of Echoes Radio featured Portal as one of their "25 Essential Echoes CDs for 2010."

Alchemy was funded entirely by Atomic Skunk fans through a partnership with Pledge Music and like Portal was produced as a gapless album. "I fell in love with the gapless album listening experience while producing Portal and as I got deeper into production on Alchemy, I began to sense how it wanted to head in the same direction." says Rich Brodsky. "In fact, as time went on, I began to see Alchemy almost as a bookend to Portal. The tracks on Alchemy all flow very seamlessly together and like Portal, take the listener on an immersive journey, culminating with a 25 minute meditative piece called, "Temple of Stars."

Like Portal, Alchemy will be released as a limited edition 6-Panel Digipak CD on May 2, 2011. Pre-orders with immediate digital download are available now at http://atomicskunk.bandcamp.com. Alchemy will also be available as a digital download at iTunes, Amazon and others beginning April 22, 2011.

Beck to release new album 'Morning Phase' in February
<TEXT>
Beck has announced plans to release his new album 'Morning Phase' in February 2014.

The US singer-songwriter has signed a new deal with Capitol Records and will release his 12th album with the label early next year. 'Morning Phase' is Beck's first album in six years, coming after 'Modern Guilt' in 2008. The album is described as being a "companion piece" to the largely acoustic 'Sea Change', released in 2002, and will include a number of guest stars.

Confirmed names set to appear on 'Morning Phase' include Justin Meldal-Johnsen, Joey Waronker, Smokey Hormel, Roger Joseph Manning Jr, and Jason Falkner. A press release comparing the album to 'Sea Change' discusses how it, "harkens back to the stunning harmonies, songcraft and staggering emotional impact of that record, while surging forward with infectious optimism".

In September, Beck released new song 'Gimme', the latest in a line of one-off single releases. It followed the release of 'Defriended' in June while July also saw the release of two versions of new track 'I Won't Be Long' - one of which featured a spoken-word monologue from Sonic Youth star Kim Gordon.

Speaking to NME earlier this year, Beck explained that he had no plans to record an album and would instead be concentrating on this series of separate singles. "For 10 years I've been talking about putting out a series of 12-inch singles, one at a time. But I was holding them back 'cos I wasn't sure what I was doing with them. And I just wanted people to hear them."

However, it is rumoured that Beck will release two albums in 2014 with a second record similar to 'Modern Guilt' following 'Morning Phase'.

Press Release: Classical Guitarist Jason Lee Greenberg Releases Progressive Metal Album, Orisonata
<TEXT>
Classical guitarist and composer, Jason Lee Greenberg, announces the release of his debut album, Orisonata, which he recorded with his wife, award winning songwriter, pianist, and vocalist, Jennifer Grassman. The couple have been writing and recording tracks for the album off and on for the past six years, and enlisted producer MD Thompson of Ivory Tower Productions of Houston in 2013 to record, engineer, and complete the project.

"This album has been a long time in the works," said Greenberg. "The closing ballad, The Muses, is a song Jennifer and I wrote on our honeymoon in Colorado nearly eight years ago. A few of the other songs, such as Oath Breaker, I performed live with my band Eden's Twilight. All of the pieces are original compositions, and I was honored to have classical saxophonist, Todd Oxford, and jazz pianist, Pamela York, guest on the album. They're both internationally acclaimed touring artists, and really gave the album a very unique flair. Progressive metal is all about reinventing, innovating, and creating. I feel that with Orisonata, we've created something fresh and never-before-heard in the metal world."

The album features seven songs, clocking over 50 minutes worth of music. Many of the songs, such as Journey To The Center Of The Earth, Unholy Creation, andThe Great Baptism, are based on literature. Others, such as The Muses and Robin Hood are based on legend and ancient mythology.

"Each song on the album has a distinct musical character," said Grassman. "When Jason asked me to write lyrics to a few of his songs, I was honestly very challenged. I needed to come up with words and a storyline that complemented and emphasized the emotion and personality of the composition. Journey To The Center Of The Earth and The Great Baptism are two I'm particularly proud of."

So far, the album as had a soft release on CD Baby and www.Orisonata.com, but will shortly be available through Amazon, Spotify, and other major retailers.
